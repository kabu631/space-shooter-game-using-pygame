# 🚀 Space Shooter: Complete Edition

A high-octane, arcade-style top-down shooter built with **Python** and **Pygame**. This edition features advanced AI, procedural sound generation, and a dynamic wave system.

## ✨ Features

* **Dynamic Combat**: $360^{\circ}$ mouse-aiming with physics-normalized movement.
* **Procedural Audio**: Real-time sound synthesis for lasers, explosions, and power-ups—no external audio files needed.
* **Tactical AI**: Includes "Shooter" enemies that maintain distance and a multi-phase Boss with homing missiles and circular burst patterns.
* **Combo System**: Earn higher scores by maintaining kill streaks (multiplier: $1 + \text{combo} \times 0.1$).
* **Power-ups**: Collect Rapid Fire, Shields, and Health drops from defeated enemies.
* **Visual Engine**: Custom particle system for explosions and engine trails, plus a parallax twinkling starfield.
